== Actuator

- http://localhost:8080/actuator
  Provides a hypermedia-driven list of all available actuator endpoints.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
  Shows application health information. It’s one of the few endpoints exposed by default even without the wildcard (`*`) exposure.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/info 
  Displays arbitrary application info (such as build or version information).

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans  
  Lists all the Spring beans in your application context along with their details.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/configprops  
  Exposes a list of all `@ConfigurationProperties` beans and their properties.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/env 
  Shows the environment properties and profiles for the application.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings 
  Displays a list of all `@RequestMapping` paths and the corresponding handler methods.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics 
  Provides various application metrics (e.g., JVM stats, HTTP request metrics).  
  *(Often combined with further querying, e.g., `/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.used`.)*

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers 
  Exposes and lets you change the logging levels of your application’s loggers.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/threaddump  
  Returns a thread dump, which is useful for diagnosing performance issues or deadlocks.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/heapdump
  Generates and returns a heap dump file of the application’s memory (provided the underlying JVM supports it).  
  *(Note: This endpoint is typically resource-intensive and should be used with caution.)*

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/httptrace
  Shows trace information for HTTP requests. *(This endpoint is available only if you have enabled HTTP tracing; it’s not always active by default.)*

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/auditevents  
  Displays audit events (if auditing is configured in your application).

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/scheduledtasks  
  Lists scheduled tasks if you’re using Spring’s scheduling support.

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/shutdown
  Allows the application to be gracefully shut down via an HTTP endpoint.  
  *(By default, this endpoint is disabled due to security concerns and must be explicitly enabled.)*

=== Important Considerations

- **Security:**  
  Exposing all endpoints, especially sensitive ones like `/actuator/env` or `/actuator/shutdown`, may pose a security risk in production environments. It’s advisable to secure these endpoints using Spring Security or to limit exposure to trusted networks.

- **Endpoint Availability:**  
  Some endpoints only become available if specific conditions are met (e.g., the presence of certain libraries, explicit enablement in configuration, or certain actuator properties). For example, `/actuator/heapdump` depends on the JVM’s support for heap dumping, and `/actuator/httptrace` must be enabled explicitly if you want to capture HTTP trace data.

- **Version Differences:**  
  The exact set of endpoints can differ between Spring Boot versions. Always refer to the [Spring Boot Actuator documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html) for the version you are using to confirm which endpoints are provided and their default security and exposure settings.
